# Frontend

Custom JS and CSS frontend for inclusion in [Canvas](http://www.instructure.com/).

# Description

The custom JS and CSS frontend is built on top of Canvas using the mechanism in Canvas for including custom .js and .css files.

The frontend changes the Canvas graphical design and user interface by using [LESS](http://lesscss.org) and custom HTML injected using JavaScript and [Handlebars.js](http://handlebarsjs.com/) templates.

The custom JS and CSS frontend is compiled and concatenated into a single CSS and JavaScript file using Node and [Grunt - JavaScript Task Runner](http://gruntjs.com)

# Getting started

If you want to to build the frontend on your local machine you need to follow the steps below. Note that some of the commands might require sudo on certain systems.

## Install Node

To build CSS and JavaScript files you need to install [Node JS](http://nodejs.org) or update to the latest version if you are already have it installed.

## Clone or download frontend project to local machine

Clone the frontend from https://github.com/matematikk-mooc/frontend or download using your browser:

```
git clone https://github.com/matematikk-mooc/frontend.git
```

## Install [GRUNT](http://gruntjs.com/) and build dependencies (Node packages)

Switch to the directory where the frontend is located and install the dependencies using [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/#mac-stable) or [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/).

```
yarn
```

or

```
npm install
```


## Start a web server on your local machine

If you want to serve the CSS and JS files on your local machine for development, you can do this using Grunt:

```
grunt serve -udv="localhost"
```

All changes in LESS (CSS) and JavaScript will automatically be compiled and are available using the following URLs:

- [http://localhost:9000/mmooc-min-dev.css](http://localhost:9000/mmooc-min-dev.css) (for development)
- [http://localhost:9000/mmooc-min.css](http://localhost:9000/mmooc-min.css) (for production)
- [http://localhost:9000/mmooc-min.js](http://localhost:9000/mmooc-min.js)
- [http://localhost:9000/badges-dev.js](http://localhost:9000/badges-dev.js) (for dev)
- [http://localhost:9000/badgesafe.js](http://localhost:9000/badgesafe.js) (for prod)
- [http://localhost:9000/badgesafe.css](http://localhost:9000/badgesafe.css)

## Build JS and CSS files for staging and production environment

Compile JS and CSS for the staging environment using 

```
grunt staging -udv="Staging_version_1_1"

```
Compile JS and CSS for the production environment using 

```
grunt build -udv="Production_version_1_1"

```
The differences between serve, staging and build can be seen in the Gruntfile.js build file. Basically there are different variables being replaced with values corresponding to the specified environments. The resulting JS and CSS file can be found in the **dist** directory

## Run Jasmine JavaScript tests

```
grunt test
```

## Visual regression tests

### Visual regression tests stack

- [Puppeteer](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer)
- [Jest](https://github.com/facebook/jest)
- [Jest Image Snapshot](https://github.com/americanexpress/jest-image-snapshot#readme)

those modules are automatically installed when you install the application, please refer to the 'Getting started' section

| puppeteer/\_\_image_snapshots\_\_ | directory with snapshots                                                   |

| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| test-env-setup.js | stores login credentials and test environment configuration, as well as consts used in test |
| jest-setup.js     | stores jest setup                                                                           |

### Configuration of the test environment

It is necessary to add login credentials to the test-env-setup.js file. Initially, the file should look like this:

```javascript
global.EMAIL = 'udir-team@netguru.co';
global.PASSWORD = '';

global.IS_HEADLESS = true;
global.URL = 'http://udir.staging.devguru.co';

global.VIEWPORT_SIZE = {
  width: 1440,
  height: 900
};

global.SELECTORS = {
  USERNAME_SELECTOR: '#pseudonym_session_unique_id',
  PASSWORD_SELECTOR: '#pseudonym_session_password',
  CHECKBOX_SELECTOR: '#pseudonym_session_remember_me',
  BUTTON_SELECTOR: '.Button--login'
};

global.JEST_IMAGE_CONFIG = {
  failureThreshold: '0.05',
  failureThresholdType: 'percent'
};
```

Add the values to the EMAIL and PASSWORD variables. Here is the example:

```javascript
global.EMAIL = 'john.smith@gmail.com';
global.PASSWORD = 'password123';
```

If you would like to test the app on a different address, please modify this line: `global.URL = 'http://udir.staging.devguru.co';`

### Good practices

#### Keeping the stable testing environment

The visual regression tests will detect minor differences between the image snapshot reference and the tested screen. Thus, editing a single module or a course syllabus will cause certain tests to fail. Therefore, it is suggested to keep one course and one user account purely for testing.

It does not mean you are not allowed to edit this course or account preferences. It just means you will have to update the image snapshot references after introducing any changes. The procedure is described below.

### Running visual regression tests

- when you run the tests for the first time, please make sure you add the login credentials to the test-env-setup.js file, which you can find in the root directory, make sure the EMAIL, PASSWORD and URL variables have correct values
- in order to run the tests use the script `yarn test:regression` (or `npm run test:regression` if you use npm)
- if the tests run for the first time, the snapshots will be created in the `puppeteer/__image_snapshots__` directory
- if any of the tests fail. you can check the difference in the `puppeteer/__image_snapshots__/__diff_output__` folder
- if the difference is unwanted, you shall attempt to remove the issue, and run the tests again `yarn test:regression`
- if the difference is a result of a willful modification (eg adding a new element or changing the style), then you shall accept the changes by running `yarn test:regression:update` (or `npm run test:regression:update` if you use npm)

#### Additional scripts

there is quite a lot of screens in the app, thus additional scripts have been created to test only some parts of the app:

- `yarn test:regression:course` tests screens associated with courses
- `yarn test:regression:user` tests user account screens

### Known issues

- sometimes page loads slower or freezes, what causes timeout errors - then the test shall be run again
- it might also happen that the test fails due to the difference caused by the fact that not all elements loaded before the image snapshot was taken - then the test shall be run again
- if you add too many assertions to one test suite, you might encounter a timeout issue - while adding new tests keep that in mind
- the test script is set to run tests sequentially in order to avoid timeout issues `"test:regression": "jest --runInBand"` thus if you prefer to use jest cli commands instead of the script itself, make sure you use such command: `yarn jest --runInBand`
- references made in headless mode differ from the ones made in headless mode switched off - if you change the mode it is a good idea to update the references as well. you can change the mode in the test-env-setup.js file in this line of code `global.IS_HEADLESS = true;`

# Deployment

Copy all files from the dist directory to your web server.
Note that addons generate different files that may be destinated to different directories in your production server.

## Image paths

The CSS files have URL references to bitmaps which are replaced at build time using grunt-text-replace. To change the URL for the production server,
modify the following section in Gruntfile.js

```
    replacements: [{
	    from: 'https://server',
		to: 'https://apps.kantega.no/mmooc'
    }]
```
